# Snippets

Similar to [KBar](https://aescripts.com/kbar/) the Labels script can be used as a script launcher. Simply assign a custom keyboard key and a path to the script and click on swatch to execute the script.

> Snippets opens a gateway to extend Labels functionality and build upon whatâ€™s already implemented in the script.

## How to create

Labels script exposes the following API:

``` javascript
index (Number)            // label index,
hex (String)              // label HEX color,
rgb ([Number])            // label RGB color [0-255, 0-255, 0-255]
name (String)             // label name
targetKeyframes (Boolean) // whether the target:keyframes is enabled in the main UI
```

The example below demonstrates how to create a simple snippet for Labels.

```javascript
// Get an active composition
var composition = app.project.activeItem;
if (!composition || !(composition instanceof CompItem)) {
  return alert('Please select a composition first');
}

// Create a Solid Layer with base color of Labels.rgb
var layer = composition.layers.addSolid(
  Labels.rgb / 255,
  'My Layer',
  composition.width,
  composition.height,
  1
);

// Set layers comment to Labels.hex color:
layer.comment = Labels.hex;

// Set layer name to Label.name
myLayer.name = Labels.name;

// Check if layer index matches Labels.index:
var layerIndex = layer.index;
var labelsIndex = Labels.index;
if (layerIndex === labelsIndex) {
  alert('Layer index of ' layerIndex + ' matches the label index of ' + labelsIndex);
} else {
  alert('Layer index of ' + layerIndex + ' does not match the label index of ' + labelsIndex);
}
```

## How to use

1. Download the snippet file from the list above and unzip it.
2. In the [Labels](/interface#main-ui) interface click on the **Settings (S)** button to open up the [Settings](/interface#settings) window.
3. In the [Settings](/interface#settings) window click the **Open snippet editor** button to open the [snippet editor](/interface#snippet-editor) window.
   1. Assing the keyboard key to be pressed to launch the snippet, for example *z*.
   2. Set the **path to script file** by clicking on **...** and selecting the snippet file that has extension *.js*.
   3. Click **save** to confirm.
4. Back in AE hold down the *key* you have assigned in previous step (i.e. *z*) and click on any label swatch in the [labels](/interface#main-ui) interface - this should launch the snippet that has been assigned to key *z*.

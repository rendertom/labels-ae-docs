# Installation

1. Unpack the archive you have downloaded and copy/paste the **Labels.jsx** file into the **ScriptUI Panels** folder:

   - **Windows**: Program Files\Adobe\Adobe After Effects \<version>\Support Files\Scripts
   - **Mac OS**: Applications/Adobe After Effects \<version>/Scripts

2. Enable **Allow Script to Write Files and Access Network** to avoid unnecessary problems while loading the interface. This option is under the **Scripting & Expressions** tab of the After Effects **Preference** panel:

   - **Windows**: Edit > Preferences > Scripting & Expressions
   - **Mac OS**: After Effects > Preferences > Scripting & Expressions

Once installation is finished run the script in After Effects by clicking **Window > Labels**.

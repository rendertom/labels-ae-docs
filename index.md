## About

Labels allow you to easily set label colors and select label groups with a single click.

Select a keyframe, layer or an item and pick a color. Or better yet, select bunch of them and apply same label color to all of them. If the selected layer has a source, or an item is used in composition, you can set the same label to both of them at once.

Labels has an easy way to filter through label groups so you can quickly see which labels are used in the composition you are working on.

Use mouse and keyboard combination to select a group of keyframes, layers or items that have same label color. With a different keyboard combo you can append to selection, select everything except current label color or remove label from selection.

[Themes](/themes) bring power to After Effects to switch Label Colors at any time without the need to restart application. Try different label colors, assignments, and save them to file to share with the team.

Similar to [KBar](/http://aescripts.com/kbar) Labels can be used as a script launcher. Simply assign custom keyboard key and set a path to the script and click on swatch to execute the script. This option opens a gateway to extend Labels functionality and build upon what’s already implemented in the script.

Grab [Themes](/themes#download) and custom script [Snippets](/snippets#download) to give your timeline a facelift.
